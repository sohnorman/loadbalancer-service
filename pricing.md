# Pricing

IBM Cloud Load Balancer pricing is based on the following three metrics, calculated monthly:

* Service Usage Hours
* Data Processed
* Outbound Public Bandwidth (Egress)

**NOTE:** All prices vary by geographic regionThe Outbound public bandwidth consumed by the IBM Cloud Load Balancer service is billed per the standard data transfer charge of [USD $0.09 per GB](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/bandwidth).

The following chart details an example IBM Cloud Load Balancer priced for a customer using 4500 GB per month for public load balancing:

| **Service Usage** | 720 hours | $0.025/hour | $18/month |
| **Data Processed** | 4500GB | $0.008/GB | $36/month |
