# FAQs

This section contains answers to some frequently asked questions about IBM Bluemix Load Balancer Service.

## If I have a firewall deployed on my public VLAN, what configurations are required on my firewall to work with my load balancer service?

TCP port 56501 is used for management. Please ensure that traffic to this port as well as your application's ports are not blocked by your firewall.

## What's the maximum number of virtual ports I can define with my load balancer service?

While trying to create a new load balancer service, you may define up to two virtual ports. You can define additional virtual ports after the service is created. The maximum number of virtual ports allowed is 10. 

## What's the maximum number of compute instances I can associate with my load balancer?

50.

## Can I create an internal-only, private load balancer that can only be accessed by internal clients?  

Not at this time. The service hosted on the IBM Bluemix load balancer will be assigned a fully qualified domain name accessible from the public Internet. 

## What are the default settings and allowed values for various health check parameters?

The default settings and allowed values are listed below:

* **Health check interval:** Default is 5 seconds, range is 2 – 60 seconds
* **Health check response timeout:** Default is 2 seconds, range is 1 – 59 seconds
* **Max Retrials:** Default is 2 retrials, range is 1 to 10 retrials

**Note:** The health check response timeout value must always be less than the health check interval value. 

## Can I use compute instances residing in remote data centers with this service? 

It is recommended that your load balancer service and your compute instances reside locally within the same data center. The load balancer service’s graphical interface (GUI) will not show compute instances from other remote data centers. However, the GUI will include compute instances from other data centers within same city (for example, data centers whose names share the first three letters, such as DALxx. You may use the API interface to add compute instances from any remote data center though. 

## Which TLS version is supported with SSL offload? Which ciphers are supported?

The Bluemix Load Balancer Service supports TLS 1.2 with SSL termination. 

The following list details the supported ciphers (listed in order of precedence):  

* ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384 
* ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA384 
* DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384 
* DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA256 
* AES256-GCM-SHA384 
* AES256-SHA256 
* ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256 
* ECDHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256 
* DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256 
* DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA256 
* AES128-GCM-SHA256 
* AES128-SHA256 

## Can I customize my SSL cipher list?

Not at this time.

## What is the maximum number of Load Balancer service instances I can create within my account? 

Currently, you may create up to 20 service instances. If you need more instances, then please contact IBM Support.
